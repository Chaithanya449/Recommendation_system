ðŸŽ¬ A simple content-based movie recommender that suggests similar films using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.
This project is a simple Content-Based Movie Recommendation System designed to suggest movies similar to a userâ€™s choice based on plot descriptions. I created a mini dataset containing movie titles and their descriptions, then processed the text data using TF-IDF (Term Frequency â€“ Inverse Document Frequency) to convert it into numerical vectors. I used cosine similarity to compare these vectors and determine how closely movies are related based on their content. The system takes a movie name as input, finds the most similar movies, and returns the top five recommendations, with case-insensitive matching for better usability. Built using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, this project demonstrates the core working of a content-based recommender by focusing solely on movie descriptions instead of ratings or user history. Through this, I achieved a fast and accurate recommendation process, learned how to implement text vectorization and similarity metrics, and structured a clean, beginner-friendly Python project that can serve as a foundation for more advanced recommendation systems in the future.
